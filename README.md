# ld

## Expectations

● Create a feature flag in an implementation of your choice. [May be as simple or complex as
you’d like.]
● You must use one of the LaunchDarkly SDKs to implement the feature flag.
● Bonus points for implementations that use targeting or other LaunchDarkly features besides the
kill switch.

## notes

Upload your solution to a public GitHub repo and be sure to include instructions on how to set up the sample implementation.

The instructions need to provide in detail how the reader can set the example up locally on their machine.

Be sure to include call-outs where the SDK key needs to be replaced, as well as the feature flag that needs to be re-created by
the user.
